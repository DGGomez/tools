#What is the max amount of money out there

According to stats as the current richest man in the world, Jeff Bezos, became the richest the number of billionaries decreased. 
So that brings the question is there a finite amount of money out there? How much can one person own? Can I track how many billionaries there are
based on the amount of money the richest man has?
